# Sannitha05-MANGO-LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION
Designed and implemented a CNN-based image classification system using Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2) to identify 7+ mango leaf disease categories. Trained on 5,000+ labeled images with preprocessing techniques such as normalization, resizing, and data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to enhance model generalization.

Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and validation testing, achieving consistent classification accuracy above 95%. Deployed the trained model via a Django REST API and integrated it with a React Native (Expo) mobile application to enable real-time leaf image prediction.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, MobileNetV2, Django REST Framework, React Native (Expo)
